<!--
	mitm.html is the lite "man in the middle"

	This is only meant to signal the opener's messageChannel to
	the service worker - when that is done this mitm can be closed
    but it's better to keep it alive since this also stops the sw
    from restarting

	The service worker is capable of intercepting all request and fork their
	own "fake" response - wish we are going to craft
	when the worker then receives a stream then the worker will tell the opener
	to open up a link that will start the download
