<!--
	mitm.html is the lite "man in the middle"

	This is only meant to signal the opener's messageChannel to
	the service worker
	The service worker is capitable of intercepting all request and fork theire
	own "fake" response - wish we are going to craft
	when the worker then recives a stream then the worker will tell this middle
	man to open up a link that will start the download
