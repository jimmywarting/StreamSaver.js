<!--
	mitm.html is the lite "man in the middle"

	This is only meant to signal the opener's messageChannel to
	the service worker - when that is done this mitm can be closed

	The service worker is capitable of intercepting all request and fork theire
	own "fake" response - wish we are going to craft
	when the worker then recives a stream then the worker will tell the opener
	to open up a link that will start the download
