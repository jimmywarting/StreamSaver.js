<!--
	ping.html is a second "man in the middle" to ping the ServiceWorker and keep it alive

	This is meant to keep the Service Worker from timing out while the download happens,
  but since we can't ping the Service Worker directly from here we use a Shared Worker
  to do the pinging. The Shared Worker stays alive until this iframe is closed.
-->
<script>
const ping = new SharedWorker('ping.js')

window.onmessage = event => ping.port.postMessage(event.data, event.ports)
</script>
